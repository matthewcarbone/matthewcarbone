ðŸ’¬ **Who am I?** ~ I am currently a forward deployed engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/). Formerly, I was an Assistant Computational Scientist (equivalent to assistant professor) at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/world/) since 2021. Previously I was [United States Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a graduate student in the [Reichman Group](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html) at Columbia University.

ðŸŽ“ **Education** ~ I hold a PhD in chemical physics from Columbia University, as well as a BS in chemistry and BA in physics from the University of Rochester. Before that, I attended Watchung Hills Regional High School in Warren, New Jersey.

âš¡ **Fun fact** ~ I have a working fluency in American Sign Language, and [performed](https://youtu.be/hJITrI47ko0) in the "Sign Idol" competition during my undergrad!
