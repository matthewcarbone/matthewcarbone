üí¨ **Who am I?** ~ I am an Assistant Computational Scientist (equivalent to assistant professor) at [Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://www.bnl.gov/world/) since 2021. Previously I was [United States Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a graduate student in the [Reichman Group](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html) at Columbia University.

üéì **Education** ~ I hold a PhD in chemical physics from Columbia University, as well as a BS in chemistry and BA in physics from the University of Rochester. Before that, I attended Watchung Hills Regional High School in Warren, New Jersey.

‚≠êÔ∏è **Outreach** ~ A few of the things I do: organize open-access [tutorials on AI/ML](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/AIML-tutorials), am a host on the [Python Exchange](https://meetup.doepy.org), and [hackathon](https://hillshacks.com) organizer at my old high school. I am _always_ interested in helping anyone learn about science or computations, so if you feel there is a way we could partner please reach out.

üî≠ **What do I do?** ~ Currently, my research lies at the intersection of chemistry/physics/materials science and computations. I apply computational techniques from the computer science, mathematics and statistics communities to solve tough scientific problems. Additionally, I work on and contribute to open-source scientific software. See my pinned repositories for a few highlighted examples!

üëØ **Work with me!** ~ I am _always_ looking for new collaborations, both on subject matter I am expert in, and also on new research problems where I am not (usually more fun!).

üì´ **Contact** ~ Feel free to reach out to me via email (see the sidebar or my [staff page](https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone)), or by messaging me on LinkedIn.

‚ö° **Fun fact** ~ I have a working fluency in American Sign Language, and [performed](https://youtu.be/hJITrI47ko0) in the "Sign Idol" competition during my undergrad!
